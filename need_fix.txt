FUNCTIONALITY
	wallbuys
		hackable, no effect
			-> 20250108 hackable, costs flip, no model flip.
			-> 20250109 done.
			-> some spots specific to other modes (Grief, Survival) had hack prompt appear. Fixed that.
			-> 20250113 made wallbuy model not flip on Origins due to the map defining level._wallbuy_override_num_bits. Might change.
		TranZit bus B23r

	Buried chalk wallbuys (some hackable, have not checked effect)
	doors (partial)
		-> debris are considered done after added functionality.
		-> 20250113 some doors have the hack prompt, but do not show it unless if the player is closer (such as with noclip).
		-> 20250116 added struct.no_sight_check defining on Buried to fix prompt not appearing, and increased trigger radius on Origins for triggers that require being closer.

	box (not all hackable, functionality tends to bug)
		-> 20250111 most are hackable, no longer buggy. Need to fix Die Rise upside-down box hack triggers.
		-> 20250113 Die Rise considered done. Need to investigate Buried.
		-> 20250116 added struct.no_sight_check defining on Buried to fix prompt not appearing, and changed setting of trigger origin to use original method except on Die Rise to avoid bugs on other maps.

	barricade repair (boards get repaired while hacker is out)
		-> 20250109 done.

	perk refunds (partial, need to account for moving perks)
		-> 20250109 done.

	add pick up spots
	investigate Max Ammo to Fire Sale behaviour on TranZit and Die Rise
		-> 20250111 runtime error and no effect once picked up. Used replaceFunc to add Max Ammo to non-hackable powerups if Fire Sale is not added.

DESIGN
	sounds
	model
	animations
	hud icon
	shooting it results in com_error, caused by weaponType
		-> 20250109 set weaponType to "mine" with unlimitedammo enabled, considered done. Might need to change.

	shooting it makes the equipment go away upon switching from it
		-> 20250109 considered done with the com_error solution. Might need to change.

	fix positioning in player hands in world view [low priority]
