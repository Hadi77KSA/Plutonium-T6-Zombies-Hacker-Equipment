FUNCTIONALITY
	wallbuys
		hackable, no effect
			-> 20250108 hackable, costs flip, no model flip.
			-> 20250109 done.
			-> some spots specific to other modes (Grief, Survival) had hack prompt appear. Fixed that.
			-> 20250113 made wallbuy model not flip on Origins due to the map defining level._wallbuy_override_num_bits. Might change.
		TranZit bus B23r
			-> 20250118 made hackable, model flips when the bus stops moving or is about to depart.

	Buried chalk wallbuys (some hackable, have not checked effect)
		-> 20250116 the hackable chalk spot was Grief mode's Olympia, which disappeared with the modification made to fix the problem of wall weapons appearing on a mode they are not intended for.
		-> 20250117 done.

	doors (partial)
		-> debris are considered done after added functionality.
		-> 20250113 some doors have the hack prompt, but do not show it unless if the player is closer (such as with noclip).
		-> 20250116 added struct.no_sight_check defining on Buried to fix prompt not appearing, and increased trigger radius on Origins for triggers that require being closer.
		-> 20250117 added checks for doors that should not be hackable on non-classic modes.
		-> 20250207 added struct.no_sight_check defining on Nuketown Zombies to fix prompt not appearing on some doors.

	box (not all hackable, functionality tends to bug)
		-> 20250111 most are hackable, no longer buggy. Need to fix Die Rise upside-down box hack triggers.
		-> 20250113 Die Rise considered done. Need to investigate Buried.
		-> 20250116 added struct.no_sight_check defining on Buried to fix prompt not appearing, and changed setting of trigger origin to use original method except on Die Rise to avoid bugs on other maps.

	barricade repair (boards get repaired while hacker is out)
		-> 20250109 done.

	perk refunds (partial, need to account for moving perks)
		-> 20250109 done.
		-> 20250116 made struct.entity only get set on Nuketown Zombies and Die Rise, and increased trigger radius on Nuketown Zombies.

	add pick up spots
		-> 20250308 added fallback function to place the Hacker in a random initial spawn location per match in case there are no Hacker spawn points. Considered done.

	investigate Max Ammo to Fire Sale behaviour on TranZit and Die Rise
		-> 20250111 runtime error and no effect once picked up. Used replaceFunc to add Max Ammo to non-hackable powerups if Fire Sale is not added.

DESIGN
	sounds
		-> 20250121 added success, fail, and in-progress hack sounds. Audio files and soundbank aliases obtained through BO3 using Scobalula's Greyhound and HydraX.

	model
		-> 20250207 added from the model exports from BO1's zombie_moon.ff through OAT. Used a modified version of "p_zom_moon_hacker_box_open" for the weapon in player viewmodel since OAT only properly imports rigid models. Materials are all done through copy-pasting similar templates based on the techniquesets.

	animations
		-> 20250308 added bobbing when sprinting. Considered done for now until OAT is able to import custom animations.

	hud icon
		-> 20250207 added, but is transparent when it has no ammo. Material is done through copy-pasting a similar template based on BO2's equipment icons.

	shooting it results in com_error, caused by weaponType
		-> 20250109 set weaponType to "mine" with unlimitedammo enabled, considered done. Might need to change.

	shooting it makes the equipment go away upon switching from it
		-> 20250109 considered done with the com_error solution. Might need to change.

	fix positioning in player hands in world view [low priority]
		-> 20250207 considered done with the addition of BO1 Moon's Hacker model.
